    <h1>WHAT HAPPENED <br>
        HERE?</h1>
    <p>The IT-Bubble, is probably the most significant thing that happened during this time period.<br>
       Hundreds of companies that were massive disapeared nearly overnight,<br> 
       though this does not mean that there were no warning signs.<br>
       <br>
       The rapid growth of companies related to the services provided on the internet rose to insane heights. <br>
       Many of these companies died out having left behind the resources for other companies to improve upon.<br> 
       However this rapied growth and collapse was not sustainable,<br> 
       investors becoming aware of the risks they were taking.</p>
