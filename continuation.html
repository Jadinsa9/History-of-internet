    <h1>TECHNOLOGY?</h1>
    <p>Most innovations of this time were not of the physical kind,<br>
       most were within the internet itself. <br>
       But there is one important innovation that came in 2007,<br> 
       the Iphone. Which revolutionized the way webbsites needed to be built. <br>
       <br>
       The Iphone required that webbsites be flexible in the way that they were built. <br>
       No longer could you define pictures and text in only pixels,<br> 
       a new method of scaling was needed.</p>
