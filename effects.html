    <h1>CONSEQUENCES <br> 
        OF THE <br>
        IT-BUBBLE</h1>
    <p>Considering the name "IT-Bubble burst" you would think that something terrible happened. <br>
       However the event is the very reason why we have large search engines such as Google, <br>
       which survived the burst with its keyword-based advertising. <br>
       The burst also left a lot of extra capacity now suddenly available after the market was cleaned of companies. <br>
       Leading to very affordable and fast connectivity that led to more people buying it for their own homes.</p>
